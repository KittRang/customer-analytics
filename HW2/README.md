<p><h1>My perspective on the Jobs to be done</h1>

I did a video on this for the class in the recording folder. So I'll just skip over the details of it.
The pdf file referenced by the recordings are in the folder.</p>

<h2>My take</h2>
<br>
Jobs to be done is about being efficient with your time as much as possible. 
<ul>
  <li>Get a coffee, so you can sleepless and spend less time being grumpy</li>
  <li>Get a milkshake, so you can skip sitting down for breakfast meaning more time to sleep in </li>
  <li>Get a milkshake latte, what's better than a coffee and a milkshake? A coffee milkshake </li>
</ul>

It is all about saving time and be efficient. That's why most successful products are about filling in the gap of something we feel like we <b>HAVE TO BUT DONT WANT TO</b> do.

I beleive there's a <b><u> The "I hate it so much I need to prevent it from ever happening" </b></u> category. i.e. condoms, sleeping pills, and messaging apps.

I would like to take this route on my Design Thinking assignment if viable.

Side note though, I will be using this product for the Design Thinking as well.
