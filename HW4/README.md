<h1>About the Customer Journey thing</h1>
<br>Let's start with the empty Canvas.

<p>You've probably seen this before in class, people usually linked this with the ecommerce and the data collection often ends up with Google Analytics, but today I'll try to go into it from the Loyalty Platform perspective.</p>

<p>Lets go over the <b>Channels</b>. 

You'll see that there are 3 additionals channels added to the default canvas; LINE,SMS, Native App. <br>

<p><h2>AWARE</h2>
The Loyalty Platform ways of generating awareness often relies on those that are "in the know", so you know, the existing customers. These people already liked and followed the Official Facebook page of the product, consume the product on a regular basis (Their own regular basis and not sales team's regular basis), or are already targeted by the brand through retargeting on Lazada or Shopee.
The trend we're currently seeing in the Thailand's Loyalty Platform market is through the Official LINE Channel. To the brands, LINE is relatively cheap (compared to native app), low barrier to entry (everyone's grandmas know how to use this), and the platform is simple enough that a small team can manage without relying heavily on IT. </p>
