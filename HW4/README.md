<h1>About the Customer Journey thing</h1>
<br>Let's start with the empty Canvas.
<br><br>
<p align="center"><img src="Canvas.jpg" height ="150"></p>
<br>
<p>You've probably seen this before in class, people usually linked this with the ecommerce and the data collection often ends up with Google Analytics, but today I'll try to go into it from the Loyalty Platform perspective.</p>

<p>Lets go over the <b>Channels</b>. 

You'll see that there are 3 additionals channels added to the default canvas; LINE,SMS, Native App. <br>
</p>
<p><h2>AWARE</h2>
The Loyalty Platform ways of generating awareness often relies on those that are "in the know", so you know, the existing customers. These people already liked and followed the Official Facebook page of the product, consume the product on a regular basis (Their own regular basis and not sales team's regular basis), or are already targeted by the brand through retargeting on Lazada or Shopee.
The trend we're currently seeing in the Thailand's Loyalty Platform market is through the Official LINE Channel. To the brands, LINE is relatively cheap (compared to native app), low barrier to entry (everyone's grandmas know how to use this), and the platform is simple enough that a small team can manage without relying heavily on IT. </p>
<p> So our awareness should look something like this

</p>
<p><h2>INTEREST</h2>
For the Loyalty Platform, we can kind of skip over the Googling to find information part since the goal of the platform, usally in the first phase, is to engage, reward, retain, and get to know the existing customers anyway.

<h3> First stage of interest </h3>

The initial hurdle for the brand starts here. There's a dilemma, the brand wants to gather just enough information at the registration stage to do their segmentation and confirm that these users are indeed your customers (Not just some randoms that will take get free rewards and leave) all the while makes it short enough that they dont scare aware the LINE followers.

<h3> Second stage of interest </h3>

Then comes the platform interactions. You can have as many features as you want, you can have the greatest content of all time, but if your site flows horribly then it doesnt matter. Your users (Now committed, registered, and took your welcome rewards) will never find them and will not see value in them.

This is the part where your users users go through your app giving you about 5 minutes (give or take, max I've seen recently is 10 minutes) to show off all your benefits so that they can decide if they will stay, participate, redeem, and consume more of your rewards for those juicy rewards.

If your users decided to stay after first session, congratulation! Your golden 3 months period starts now.
<br>Before I go into purchase/redeem, let's check our that graph
<p align="center"><img src="images/interest.jpg" height = "450"></p>

<p><h2>Purchase/Redeem</h2>
What makes Loyalty platform more difficult than e-commerce platform is the <b> Four non-impulsive decision making steps</b> that each customers will have to go through to get the most out of the loyalty platform.

Welcome, to <b>The GRIND</b>
<br>
 <ol>
  <li>They have to decide to buy the product</li>
  <li>They have to remember that there's a brand platform</li>
  <li>They have to keep the packaging of that product and fill in the codes for points</li>
  <li>They have to want the rewards enough to keep repeating step 2 and 3 over and over</li>
</ol> 
<br>

The trick here is to finds out just how much each user normally consumes and set the rewards just above that threshold in a sensible time frame. 

So let's say
-> Timmy eats 4 packs of chips per week 
-> Timmy wants a voucher for beer 
-> Brand finds a voucher that's worth around a month of Timmy's normal consumption plus 10%

Now Timmy does not feel pressured by the consumption goal and feel that the reward he wants is attainable.
<br><b>The goal of the brand is to push that ATTAINABLE feeling in the users</b><br>

Too low and the brand lose out on sales and lose out on the money spent on too many rewards.
Too high and the users leave.
Balance this, coupled with strong marketing, and you should be good for a long haul.

Now to the graph:
<p align="center"><img src="images/purchase.jpg" height = "450"></p>
</p>
<p><h2>REPURCHASE</h2>

Congratuations! 50% of those that made 1st redeem/purchase will do it the 2nd time without the brand having to pour as much into promotions.
The <b> Four non-impulsive decision making steps </b> are still ongoing but now, at least part 2 and 3 are a part of their daily/weekly routine.

The decisions that brand will have to make here are the blancing act of keeping the rewards interesting while keeping what each client wants avialable. It does not have to be the same product but the brand needs to know what these purchased customers preferred.

The brand also have to come up with new campaign to keep things engaging. The terrible thing about the Official channel other than Facebook is that they alerted the consumers. It's a double edge sword. On one hand, the engaging users would love to know if there are any new info, new promotions, new things to redeem. Then there are also users who are on the fence about leaving and one wrong move here results in the deletion of app or instant block in notifications.

Reactivation campaigns are needed but must be carefully utilized.
